INSTALLATION

RUNNING THE APPLICATION
The project uses TypeScript, so you need to compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript before running the application.
* npx tsc

The project uses nodemon to automatically restart the server on code changes. Start the server using the following command:
* go to dist folder
* run command - node index.js

The server should now be running on http://localhost:3000 by default.
